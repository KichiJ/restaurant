        At Smooth's, our mission is simple: enhance and educate the palate with
        the freshest ingredients and flavors, while surprising and exciting each
        guest with personal care and service. For us, sustainability is not a
        lofty idea but a fundamental, and necessary, endeavor. Our concept is
        about the food and drink of course, but itâ€™s also about our team, our
        facilities, our practices, and the hundreds of decisions we make each
        day that affect the world around us.
